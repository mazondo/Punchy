==Welcome to Punchy!

Punchy is a super simple, straight forward rails 3.0 app that allows you to keep track of what you've been working on.

==How it works

The premise is simple: setting up projects and clients sucks.  No drop down menus, one button, nothing else.  You can begin logging your work within seconds.  To input a new time punch, simply type in something to the effect of "*programmed for @client_1 for 4 hours on #project_1"  Anything starting with a "*" is recorded as an action, "#" is recorded as a project and "@" is recorded as a client.

That's it!  Punchy will keep track of all the minutes you work and let you know where all your time is going!

==Why?

I developed Punchy so I could log the time I spend on various projects the way I choose to - with minimal interference in my day.  I prefer to work without interference and then log my time after the fact.

==Deploying on Heroku

Punchy can be deployed on Heroku!  To do so, you just need to make sure you use the bamboo stack because Punchy uses Rails 3.0.  Run the following commands to get up and running in seconds:

heroku create your_subdomain --stack bamboo-ree-1.8.7
git push heroku master
heroku rake db:migrate

and you're done!

==But the days are all messed up?

Punchy is currently set to US Mountain Time.  If you live elsewhere, you'll need to update the setting in config/application.rb to suit your needs.
